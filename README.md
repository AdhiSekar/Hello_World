# ClimberBot

This project was made as part of testing and training at Team Robocon at SRM University. 
It is required to sense and navigate to a given ladder and then climb to the top.
We have divided our bot into two independant bots , the carrier bot and the main bot.
The carrier bot carries the main bot to the ladder and the main bot climbs it.
We in order to prevent hard coding, we have used some sensors including, a bump switch, a ps2 controller and a SharpIR sensor.
